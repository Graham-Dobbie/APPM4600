1. I think that the lazy newton every 4 iterations makes the most sence because the first and maybe second iterations after the update will be helped and then the next are back to linear.
4. Mine compares very well agianst my classmate and it only computes 1 time

2. it seems like the size of h doesn't change the convergence particularly all the much, maybe if the initial guess was more outside of the region of convergence then it would matter
